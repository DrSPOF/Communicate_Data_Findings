# Data Visualisation GoFordBike Trip Data 



## Dataset

This project explores a dataset from GoFordBike for Boston and Washington for the period Dec 2019 - Nov 2020. The data set includes data relating to stations, dates, duration and city and has these details for a total of 4+ milion trips. 


## Summary of Findings

In general terms I found that the trip durations and number of trips lines up with what I was expecting to see in a monthly trend. The month of April seems to be an anomaly in number of trips, and interestingly also in the duration. With the number of trips being very low and the duration being high. 
_Feedback provided by Mark Jensen_: It could be worth looking into this further to ensure there are no quality issues with the data for that particular month. It is especially interesting since this unexpected result is shown for both Washington and Boston. Would other cities show the same? 

## Key Insights for Presentation

A key insight found is the expected trend to see more trips and longer duration in spring and summer months for both cities compared to the colder autumn and winter months. 
A second key insight is the duration of trips being longer for casual users vs members or subscribers. I was expecting to find this as I'd expect casual riders to use the bike for a leisure trip and subscribers or members to use the bike for a regular commute.
